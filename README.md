# LociMirror---NMNT-Project

LociMirror is a low-fi prototype of a digital mirror that can be used as a memory aid. 
The program was created as an assignment for the openFrameworks course at Leiden University (The Netherlands). 
The ofxFaceTracker library of Kyle McDonald was used as a basis for the face tracking functionality.
